During my first-year summer, I had the privilege to collaborate with a USA-based client on an impactful project. I designed and developed a sophisticated C# Windows service tailored for efficient document handling. This project enhanced my confidence and provided invaluable insights into real-world industry practices.

Key Features:

Automated Document Processing: Streamlined document handling with accuracy.
Background Operation: Uninterrupted document management in the background.
Integration with Data Sources: Seamlessly retrieve and store documents from multiple locations.
Client-Centric Approach: Close collaboration with the client for tailored solutions.
